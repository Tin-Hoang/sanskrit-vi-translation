    "606efb76a739d054": "{\"accuracy\": 5, \"fluency\": 5, \"explanation\": \"The translation is perfectly accurate, capturing the meaning of 'svabh\\u0101va \\u015b\\u016bny\\u0101n' as 'kh\\u00f4ng c\\u00f3 t\\u1ef1 t\\u00ednh' precisely. The Vietnamese phrasing is natural and fluent.\"}",
    "77c0167603f22cdf": "{\"accuracy\": 3, \"fluency\": 2, \"explanation\": \"The use of the Chinese character '\\u5c31\\u662f' is a major fluency error. 'V\\u00f4 t\\u00ednh' for '\\u015b\\u016bnyat\\u0101' (emptiness) is an interpretive choice that deviates from the standard 'kh\\u00f4ng' and can be less precise. The overall phrasing is a bit clunky.\"}",

The phrase 'apr\\u0101ptitv\\u0101d' is also omitted. The rest of the sentence is fluent.\"}",
    "fbd16d7a782eac0d": "{\"accuracy\": 3, \"fluency\": 5, \"explanation\": \"A significant part of the source, 'atrasto' (fearless), is omitted from the translation, which impacts the overall meaning. The translated parts are fluent.\"}",

However, keeping 'bodhi svaha' in Sanskrit rather than the traditional Vietnamese transliteration 'b\\u1ed3 \\u0111\\u1ec1 t\\u00e1t b\\u00e0 ha' makes it slightly less fluent for a Vietnamese Buddhist context, though it's common for mantras.\"}"
