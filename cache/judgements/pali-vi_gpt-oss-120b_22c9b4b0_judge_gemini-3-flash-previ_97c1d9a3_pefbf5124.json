    "376faca2f5c30597": "{\"accuracy\": 4, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"Accurate overall, though 'vui v\\u1ebb' is a bit light for 'pasannena' (pure/serene).\"}",

    "8ef8a85bb121bd9b": "{\"accuracy\": 1, \"fluency\": 2, \"explanation\": \"Major errors. 'N\\u016bpanayhanti' (not harboring) is translated as 't\\u00e1i tr\\u1ea3 th\\u00f9' (retaliating). 'Upasammati' (is stilled) is translated as '\\u0111\\u1ed3ng \\u00fd' (agreeing).\"}",

    "b86c7effa828c63f": "{\"accuracy\": 4, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"Generally accurate, though 't\\u00e2m t\\u0129nh' is a loose translation for 'matta\\u00f1\\u00f1u' (moderation).\"}",
