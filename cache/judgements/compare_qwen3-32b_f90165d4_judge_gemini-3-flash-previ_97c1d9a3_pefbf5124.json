    "6a9d22f4e09f6918": "{\"accuracy\": 4, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"Accurate, but 'b\\u00e1nh xe theo b\\u00e1nh ng\\u1ef1a' is slightly awkward compared to 'b\\u00e1nh xe theo ch\\u00e2n v\\u1eadt k\\u00e9o'.\"}",
    "ad9581c8db96e922": "{\"accuracy\": 5, \"fluency\": 5, \"explanation\": \"Accurate and flows naturally in Vietnamese.\"}",
    "3466cf2eefec8a42": "{\"accuracy\": 1, \"fluency\": 3, \"explanation\": \"Completely incorrect meaning. The source describes someone being abused/robbed, but the candidate says the person did NOT do those things.\"}",
    "2256922b236819d5": "{\"accuracy\": 1, \"fluency\": 3, \"explanation\": \"Completely incorrect meaning. It reverses the logic of the Pali text regarding non-hatred and enemies.\"}",
    "d4eeb3847f66ce9e": "{\"accuracy\": 5, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"Accurate translation of the eternal law of non-hatred.\"}",
    "c6ba252988d2ba0b": "{\"accuracy\": 3, \"fluency\": 3, \"explanation\": \"The second half is vague. It misses the specific point about 'quarrels being stilled' (sammanti medhag\\u0101).\"}",
    "9e75f711975ae92b": "{\"accuracy\": 3, \"fluency\": 3, \"explanation\": \"Incorrectly translates 'Subh\\u0101nupassi\\u1e43' (contemplating the pleasant) as 'kh\\u00f4ng qu\\u00e1n x\\u00e9t s\\u1ef1 x\\u1ea5u'. Includes Chinese characters (\\u9b54\\u738b) which is non-standard for Vietnamese text.\"}",
    "9a95259f5cd850ec": "{\"accuracy\": 4, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"Accurate, though 's\\u1ef1 x\\u1ea5u' is a bit informal for 'Asubha'. Again uses Chinese characters for Mara.\"}",
    "b8273dce9ef84fc5": "{\"accuracy\": 4, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"Good translation, captures the essence of not being worthy of the robe.\"}",
    "d8d1719290400725": "{\"accuracy\": 4, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"Accurate and clear.\"}",
    "f7bfe9d50c28b9a2": "{\"accuracy\": 4, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"Captures the meaning of 's\\u0101ra' (essence/substance) well.\"}",
    "b72b567808b48ae7": "{\"accuracy\": 4, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"Consistent with the previous item, accurate.\"}",
    "1996cc7bd039313d": "{\"accuracy\": 3, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"Changes 'rain' (vu\\u1e6d\\u1e6dh\\u012b) to 'wind' (gi\\u00f3), which alters the traditional imagery, though the metaphor remains similar.\"}",
    "2109c234e9eedeba": "{\"accuracy\": 3, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"Again, changes 'rain' to 'wind'.\"}",
    "bb056e767cc74966": "{\"accuracy\": 4, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"Accurate. 'B\\u1ecb x\\u00e9 n\\u00e1t' is a strong choice for 'viha\\u00f1\\u00f1ati' but acceptable.\"}",
    "c2f66235fca8d3e5": "{\"accuracy\": 5, \"fluency\": 5, \"explanation\": \"Accurate and natural.\"}",
    "23461c2e02a1d2cf": "{\"accuracy\": 5, \"fluency\": 5, \"explanation\": \"Very accurate translation of the suffering of the evil-doer.\"}",
    "1d8b2f0c104b0651": "{\"accuracy\": 5, \"fluency\": 5, \"explanation\": \"Very accurate translation of the joy of the merit-maker.\"}",
    "796edeef51e79fdd": "{\"accuracy\": 2, \"fluency\": 3, \"explanation\": \"Inaccurate. Misses the 'cowherd' (gopa) metaphor entirely and misinterprets 'sahita\\u1e43' (scriptures/texts).\"}",
    "ad20f010f697218c": "{\"accuracy\": 4, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"Generally accurate, though 'khi\\u00eam t\\u1ed1n' (humble) is not explicitly in the Pali 'Appampi ce sahita\\u1e43' (even if little of the texts).\"}",
    "a239675a503c4729": "{\"accuracy\": 4, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"Accurate, but '\\u0111i\\u1ec1u thi\\u1ec7n ph\\u00e1p' is slightly redundant as 'ph\\u00e1p' (dharm\\u0101) here refers to mental phenomena in general, not just 'good' ones.\"}",
    "597ef362b4715e08": "{\"accuracy\": 4, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"Similar to Item 1, '\\u0111i\\u1ec1u thi\\u1ec7n ph\\u00e1p' is a bit specific for 'dharm\\u0101', but the overall meaning and flow are good.\"}",
    "dc2de00f57a9eac2": "{\"accuracy\": 3, \"fluency\": 3, \"explanation\": \"Misses the specific nuances of 'ayojan' (bound/restrained) and 'aj\\u0101payet' (conquered/robbed). 'Kh\\u00f4ng th\\u1ec3 ti\\u00eau di\\u1ec7t t\\u00f4i' is a loose interpretation.\"}",
    "ebbd5c3a1c28980d": "{\"accuracy\": 3, \"fluency\": 3, \"explanation\": \"Same issues as Item 3 regarding the first half of the verse. The second half is accurate.\"}",
    "eeae5375dd1ae75c": "{\"accuracy\": 5, \"fluency\": 5, \"explanation\": \"Excellent translation, captures the essence of the 'San\\u0101tana Dharma' perfectly in natural Vietnamese.\"}",
    "512a8b537ae32525": "{\"accuracy\": 3, \"fluency\": 3, \"explanation\": \"The phrase 'vayam atra yam\\u0101mahe' (we perish/restrain ourselves here) is translated vaguely as 'doing what'. 'Medhak\\u0101\\u1e25' (quarrels) is translated as 'ng\\u01b0\\u1eddi tr\\u00ed' (wise person), which is incorrect.\"}",
    "fa0f8ced95003bc0": "{\"accuracy\": 4, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"Good, but '\\u015aubh\\u0101nupa\\u015by\\u012b' refers to dwelling on the 'attractive/pleasant' aspects of things, which '\\u0111i\\u1ec1u l\\u00e0nh' doesn't quite capture in this context.\"}",
    "eeafaa72cfd1c41f": "{\"accuracy\": 4, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"Accurate. 'A\\u015bubh\\u0101nupa\\u015by\\u012b' (contemplating the unattractive) is rendered as '\\u0111i\\u1ec1u d\\u1eef', which is acceptable but slightly off-target for the meditative context.\"}",
    "e0dea0fc8ca31b80": "{\"accuracy\": 5, \"fluency\": 5, \"explanation\": \"Very clear and accurate translation of the sentiment regarding the saffron robe.\"}",

    "77fc5cc63792d641": "{\"accuracy\": 4, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"Accurate use of 'b\\u1ea3n ch\\u1ea5t' for 's\\u0101ra', though 'tinh hoa' or 'c\\u1ed1t l\\u00f5i' is more common in Buddhist Vietnamese.\"}",
    "3e15d94a0aa56d24": "{\"accuracy\": 4, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"Accurate and mirrors the structure of the Sanskrit verse well.\"}",
    "2ec3420f740bce46": "{\"accuracy\": 5, \"fluency\": 5, \"explanation\": \"Simple, elegant, and perfectly captures the metaphor of the poorly roofed house.\"}",

    "9627742fe924cef2": "{\"accuracy\": 4, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"Accurate. 'B\\u1ecb ti\\u00eau di\\u1ec7t' is a bit strong for 'vihanyate' (suffers/is distressed), but acceptable.\"}",

    "bf0512fbac0f67bd": "{\"accuracy\": 4, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"Generally accurate, though 'v\\u1edbi \\u00fd \\u0111\\u1ecbnh' is a weak translation for 'sahita\\u1e43' (scriptures/meaningful texts).\"}"
