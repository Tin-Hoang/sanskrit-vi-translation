    "20618cfd248ba5ad": "{\"accuracy\": 3, \"fluency\": 3, \"explanation\": \"The translation of 'manomay\\u0101' as 'do t\\u00e2m t\\u1ea1o' is acceptable, but 'd\\u01b0\\u01a1ng kh\\u1ed5' is a typo or mistranslation for '\\u0111au kh\\u1ed5'. 'B\\u00e1nh xe theo ch\\u00e2n xe' is redundant; it should be 'ch\\u00e2n v\\u1eadt k\\u00e9o'.\"}",
    "a2e92b81017b96fc": "{\"accuracy\": 4, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"Accurate and fluent, though it omits the first two lines of the Pali verse found in the source.\"}",
    "8e2a0023464173b9": "{\"accuracy\": 2, \"fluency\": 3, \"explanation\": \"Mistranslates 'ajini ma\\u1e43' (he defeated me) as 'calling me a sinner' and 'na sammati' (is not stilled) as 'do not have the right'.\"}",
    "7f92fc78cb681d8d": "{\"accuracy\": 2, \"fluency\": 3, \"explanation\": \"Similar errors to Item 3; 'tes\\u016bpasammati' (is stilled) is incorrectly translated as 'considered to be right'.\"}",
    "2e6128cfe6a1c200": "{\"accuracy\": 3, \"fluency\": 3, \"explanation\": \"The logic in the second half is reversed/confused in Vietnamese: 'b\\u1eb1ng kh\\u00f4ng th\\u00f9 h\\u1eadn th\\u00ec sinh th\\u00f9 h\\u1eadn' means 'by non-hatred, hatred is born', which is the opposite of the Pali.\"}",
    "38996633033dea65": "{\"accuracy\": 2, \"fluency\": 3, \"explanation\": \"Mistranslates 'yam\\u0101mase' (we perish/restrain) as 'don't blame me' and 'medhag\\u0101' (quarrels) as 'wise people'.\"}",
    "c6282eac34aa770e": "{\"accuracy\": 3, \"fluency\": 3, \"explanation\": \"Translates 'subh\\u0101nupassi\\u1e43' (contemplating the pleasant) as 'nh\\u1eadn th\\u1ee9c t\\u1ed1t' (good perception), which misses the Buddhist technical meaning of 'attractive/pure features'.\"}",
    "1e6307fed0fd620a": "{\"accuracy\": 3, \"fluency\": 3, \"explanation\": \"Translates 'asubh\\u0101nupassi\\u1e43' (contemplating the unpleasant) as 'nh\\u1eadn th\\u1ee9c kh\\u00f4ng t\\u1ed1t' (not good perception) and 'matta\\u00f1\\u00f1u\\u1e43' (moderate) as 'ngu d\\u1ed1t' (ignorant).\"}",
    "b33222e096fed684": "{\"accuracy\": 1, \"fluency\": 2, \"explanation\": \"Major hallucination: 'k\\u0101s\\u0101va\\u1e43' (saffron robe) is mistranslated as 'g\\u1ea1o' (rice) and 'arahati' (worthy) as 'gi\\u1ebft' (kill).\"}",
    "665ae9a1b87dbd4b": "{\"accuracy\": 1, \"fluency\": 2, \"explanation\": \"Same hallucination as Item 9, treating 'k\\u0101s\\u0101va' as rice and 'arahati' as killing.\"}",
    "51605a9368216970": "{\"accuracy\": 3, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"Translates 's\\u0101ra' (essence/substance) as 'c\\u00e1i t\\u00f4i' (ego/self), which is a specific philosophical interpretation rather than a literal translation.\"}",

    "ecbf40be6f8b162b": "{\"accuracy\": 4, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"Good translation, though 'gi\\u1ea3i tho\\u00e1t' (liberation) for 'suggati\\u1e43' (happy state/heaven) is slightly imprecise.\"}",
    "b05d93995da1d087": "{\"accuracy\": 2, \"fluency\": 3, \"explanation\": \"Mistranslates 'sahita\\u1e43' (scriptures) as 'c\\u00f9ng nhau' (together) and 'gopova' (like a cowherd) as 'nh\\u01b0 b\\u00f2' (like a cow).\"}",
    "acbb3dc2ac406f46": "{\"accuracy\": 4, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"Generally accurate, though 'g\\u1eafn b\\u00f3' for 'sahita\\u1e43' is a bit vague in this context.\"}",
    "3829217239ab5f9e": "{\"accuracy\": 3, \"fluency\": 3, \"explanation\": \"The candidate captures the general idea but mistranslates 'dharm\\u0101' as '\\u0110\\u1ea1o' (Way) instead of 'phenomena/mental states'. 'Nhanh tr\\u00ed' is a literal but poor translation for 'manojav\\u0101\\u1e25' (mind-swift). The ending is slightly clunky.\"}",
    "8984fbd8811fda87": "{\"accuracy\": 3, \"fluency\": 3, \"explanation\": \"Similar to Item 1, '\\u0110\\u1ea1o' is inaccurate for 'dharm\\u0101'. 'B\\u00f3ng t\\u1ed1i' (darkness) is a mistranslation of 'ch\\u0101y\\u0101' (shadow), which changes the metaphor's nuance.\"}",
    "563d16b66944bc8a": "{\"accuracy\": 2, \"fluency\": 2, \"explanation\": \"The candidate translates the source as a command ('\\u0110\\u1eebng' - Don't), whereas the Sanskrit describes past actions ('He abused me, he struck me'). This is a significant grammatical error.\"}",
    "e49b5f0cb5f8b2b4": "{\"accuracy\": 2, \"fluency\": 2, \"explanation\": \"Same error as Item 3; it treats the description of past grievances as a set of prohibitions.\"}",

The phrasing 'kh\\u00f4ng ph\\u1ea3i b\\u1eb1ng k\\u1ebb th\\u00f9' is very unnatural in Vietnamese.\"}",
    "ac3f24c24006c6cb": "{\"accuracy\": 2, \"fluency\": 2, \"explanation\": \"Major error: 'medhak\\u0101\\u1e25' (quarrels/strife) is mistranslated as 'con ong' (bees). 'Yam\\u0101mahe' (we restrain ourselves/perish) is translated as 'giam gi\\u1eef' (detain), which is incorrect in context.\"}",

    "0dbc8b8b37af793e": "{\"accuracy\": 3, \"fluency\": 3, \"explanation\": \"The candidate uses 't\\u0103ng' (monk) to explain the concept, which is acceptable for meaning, but misses the specific nuance of 'ka\\u1e63\\u0101ya' (impurities) vs 'k\\u0101\\u1e63\\u0101ya' (saffron robe).\"}",
    "7a3419325a8140f1": "{\"accuracy\": 3, \"fluency\": 3, \"explanation\": \"Similar to Item 9, it simplifies the text significantly but conveys the basic message that a monk must be worthy of the robe.\"}",
    "6b55d259eacbc4a8": "{\"accuracy\": 2, \"fluency\": 3, \"explanation\": \"The candidate introduces 'ng\\u00e3' (self) and 'v\\u00f4 ng\\u00e3' (non-self), which are not in the text. The text refers to 's\\u0101ra' (essence/substance) and 'as\\u0101ra' (insubstantial).\"}",
    "7a08380f8556f14c": "{\"accuracy\": 2, \"fluency\": 3, \"explanation\": \"Same error as Item 11; it forces the 'self/non-self' terminology onto a text about 'essence/truth'.\"}",
    "b5e71817fa696597": "{\"accuracy\": 4, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"A good translation. 'D\\u00ednh say' is a bit informal for 'r\\u0101ga\\u1e25' (lust/passion), but the meaning is preserved.\"}",

    "83a134deb4c17cdd": "{\"accuracy\": 4, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"Accurate translation of the dual suffering in this life and the next. 'Ti\\u00eau di\\u1ec7t' is a bit strong for 'vihanyate' (distressed/afflicted), but acceptable.\"}",
    "6638fb5b6cdc5165": "{\"accuracy\": 5, \"fluency\": 5, \"explanation\": \"Very accurate and flows naturally in Vietnamese. Correctly identifies the joy resulting from pure actions.\"}",
