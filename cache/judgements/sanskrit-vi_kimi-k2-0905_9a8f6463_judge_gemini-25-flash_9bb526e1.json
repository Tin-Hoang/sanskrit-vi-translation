    "c47f234d42e81f56": "{\"accuracy\": 5, \"fluency\": 5, \"explanation\": \"The translation accurately captures all elements, especially 'svabh\\u0101va \\u015b\\u016bny\\u0101n' (t\\u1ef1 t\\u00e1nh) which is crucial and often simplified in other versions. The phrasing is natural and clear.\"}",
    "135a325813885cde": "{\"accuracy\": 5, \"fluency\": 5, \"explanation\": \"The translation precisely distinguishes between the three distinct clauses in the Sanskrit ('is', 'not separate', 'what is...that is'), which is more accurate than the reference. The language is natural and easy to understand.\"}",
    "7dd1b6e701f6231d": "{\"accuracy\": 5, \"fluency\": 5, \"explanation\": \"A perfect and natural translation of the Sanskrit phrase, using common Vietnamese Buddhist terminology.\"}",
    "6acc9143147c0ce0": "{\"accuracy\": 5, \"fluency\": 5, \"explanation\": \"The translation accurately renders all negations, particularly 'amal\\u0101 avimal\\u0101' as 'kh\\u00f4ng nh\\u01a1 kh\\u00f4ng s\\u1ea1ch' and 'an\\u016bn\\u0101 aparip\\u016br\\u1e47\\u0101\\u1e25' as 'kh\\u00f4ng thi\\u1ebfu kh\\u00f4ng th\\u1eeba', which are more precise than the reference. The fluency is excellent.\"}",
    "69224c68d35ffcfe": "{\"accuracy\": 5, \"fluency\": 5, \"explanation\": \"A perfectly accurate and fluent translation, clearly conveying the meaning of negation within emptiness.\"}",
    "36c3e3f69119a316": "{\"accuracy\": 5, \"fluency\": 5, \"explanation\": \"A direct, accurate, and natural translation of the sense organs.\"}",

    "0c9dbf28db2d9352": "{\"accuracy\": 3, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"The translation of 'cak\\u1e63\\u016br-dh\\u0101tu\\u1e25' as 'gi\\u1edbi nh\\u00e3n th\\u1ee9c' is a minor inaccuracy. 'Cak\\u1e63\\u016br-dh\\u0101tu\\u1e25' means 'eye element' (nh\\u00e3n gi\\u1edbi), not 'eye-consciousness element' (nh\\u00e3n th\\u1ee9c gi\\u1edbi). The fluency is generally good but the specific phrasing 'gi\\u1edbi nh\\u00e3n th\\u1ee9c' is slightly less common than 'nh\\u00e3n gi\\u1edbi'.\"}",
    "6febd56b3ff3ecae": "{\"accuracy\": 5, \"fluency\": 5, \"explanation\": \"A perfectly accurate and fluent translation of the chain of dependent origination's negations.\"}",

    "dc6f703940fddae9": "{\"accuracy\": 5, \"fluency\": 5, \"explanation\": \"The translation is highly accurate, especially in rendering 'na-apr\\u0101pti\\u1e25' as 'kh\\u00f4ng kh\\u00f4ng \\u0111\\u1ea1t \\u0111\\u01b0\\u1ee3c', which is a challenging phrase. The reference omits this crucial part. Fluency is excellent.\"}",
    "04b7bde3341f6082": "{\"accuracy\": 5, \"fluency\": 5, \"explanation\": \"The translation is highly accurate, including all elements of the Sanskrit sentence, such as 'tasm\\u0101c ch\\u0101riputra' and 'apr\\u0101ptitv\\u0101d', which are missing in the reference. The phrasing is natural and clear.\"}",
    "3fa4dcd0fc1984dc": "{\"accuracy\": 5, \"fluency\": 5, \"explanation\": \"The translation is accurate and fluent, correctly capturing the causal link and avoiding the extra 'm\\u1ed9ng t\\u01b0\\u1edfng' found in the reference.\"}",
    "59c1ba3780577cbf": "{\"accuracy\": 5, \"fluency\": 5, \"explanation\": \"A perfectly accurate and fluent translation, using standard Vietnamese Buddhist terminology for 'anuttar\\u0101\\u1e43 samyaksambodhim'.\"}",

    "d12fbda5c09e1dd0": "{\"accuracy\": 5, \"fluency\": 5, \"explanation\": \"This is a standard and universally accepted transliteration of the mantra, which is the correct approach for such texts. Both accuracy and fluency are perfect for this context.\"}"
