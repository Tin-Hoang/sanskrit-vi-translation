    "53a80ae4c4d8ace7": "{\"accuracy\": 3, \"fluency\": 3, \"explanation\": \"The translation has minor inaccuracies. '\\u0110i\\u1ec1m \\u0111\\u1ea7u' for 'pubba\\u1e45gam\\u0101' is unusual; 'd\\u1eabn \\u0111\\u1ea7u' or '\\u0111i tr\\u01b0\\u1edbc' is more common. 'T\\u1ea1o ra t\\u1ea5t c\\u1ea3' is an overstatement for 'manomay\\u0101'. 'Ch\\u00e2n ng\\u1ef1a' is too specific for 'vahato pada\\u1e43' (foot of the puller/drawer). The phrasing 'l\\u1ea5y t\\u00e2m l\\u00e0m \\u0111i\\u1ec1m \\u0111\\u1ea7u' is slightly awkward.\"}",
    "f9dbdf4e6ef6a135": "{\"accuracy\": 3, \"fluency\": 3, \"explanation\": \"Similar to Item 1, '\\u0111i\\u1ec1m \\u0111\\u1ea7u' and 't\\u1ea1o ra t\\u1ea5t c\\u1ea3' are minor inaccuracies. The overall phrasing is slightly less natural than the reference.\"}",
    "f9777057ae0bb3ae": "{\"accuracy\": 1, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"The first line is completely misinterpreted. The Pali describes past grievances ('It abused me, it struck me, it defeated me, it robbed me'), but the candidate translates it as negative imperatives ('\\u0110\\u1eebng x\\u00fac ph\\u1ea1m t\\u00f4i, \\u0111\\u1eebng gi\\u1ebft t\\u00f4i, \\u0111\\u1eebng l\\u00e0m t\\u00f4i b\\u1ecb th\\u01b0\\u01a1ng'). This is a major error. The second part also misinterprets 'upanayhanti' (harbor resentment) as 'g\\u00e2y ra th\\u00f9 h\\u1eadn'.\"}",
    "b9563a6d026d9820": "{\"accuracy\": 1, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"Similar to Item 3, the first line is completely misinterpreted from past grievances to negative imperatives. This is a major error. The second part is more accurate but the initial misinterpretation is too significant.\"}",
    "d5d958dbd7aa9dc3": "{\"accuracy\": 4, \"fluency\": 5, \"explanation\": \"The translation is very fluent and captures the core meaning well. 'T\\u00ecnh y\\u00eau th\\u01b0\\u01a1ng' is a common and acceptable interpretation of 'averena' (non-hatred) in this context. '\\u1ede b\\u1ea5t k\\u1ef3 n\\u01a1i n\\u00e0o' for '\\u012bdha' (here, in this world) is slightly broader but acceptable. Overall, a very good translation.\"}",
    "0ef1c41d3478bd18": "{\"accuracy\": 1, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"The translation completely misses the crucial meaning of 'yam\\u0101mase' (we are perishing/dying), translating it as 'ch\\u00fang ta bi\\u1ebft r\\u00f5 \\u1edf \\u0111\\u00e2y'. This is a major error. 'Medhag\\u0101' (quarrels/disputes) is also misinterpreted as 's\\u1ef1 ch\\u1ea5m d\\u1ee9t, v\\u1edbi tr\\u00ed tu\\u1ec7 s\\u1eafc s\\u1ea3o', which is an addition and misinterpretation.\"}",
    "1f5304653b395ee4": "{\"accuracy\": 2, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"There is a major error in translating 'amatta\\u00f1\\u00f1u\\u1e43' (immoderate in food) as 'bi\\u1ebft v\\u1eeba \\u0111\\u1ee7 trong vi\\u1ec7c \\u0103n u\\u1ed1ng' (moderate in food), which is the opposite meaning. Other parts are generally accurate and fluent.\"}",

'S\\u1ee9c m\\u1ea1nh' for 'v\\u012briya\\u1e43' (effort/diligence) is slightly less precise than 'tinh c\\u1ea7n' but acceptable. The contrast with Item 7's error for 'matta\\u00f1\\u00f1u\\u1e43' is correctly handled here.\"}",
    "b612c57db29da500": "{\"accuracy\": 4, \"fluency\": 5, \"explanation\": \"The translation is fluent and largely accurate. 'Tham \\u00e1i' for 'kas\\u0101va' (impurities/defilements) is a specific defilement, whereas 'u\\u1ebf tr\\u01b0\\u1ee3c' is a broader and more accurate term. However, the overall meaning is preserved.\"}",
    "2efc503ba2a5cc8f": "{\"accuracy\": 2, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"The translation completely omits 's\\u012blesu susam\\u0101hito' (well-established in virtues/precepts), which is a major error. 'Tham \\u00e1i' for 'kas\\u0101va' is also a minor inaccuracy as in Item 9.\"}",
    "f6f72bb73bf41251": "{\"accuracy\": 2, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"The first line 'As\\u0101re s\\u0101ramatino, s\\u0101re c\\u0101s\\u0101radassino' is significantly misinterpreted and incomplete. The candidate only translates the first part ('perceiving the essential in the non-essential') and misses the second part ('perceiving the non-essential in the essential'). This is a major error.\"}",
    "34e18d9e96964057": "{\"accuracy\": 5, \"fluency\": 5, \"explanation\": \"This is an excellent translation, accurately capturing the nuanced meaning of 's\\u0101ra' and 'as\\u0101ra' and the concept of right thought. The Vietnamese is natural and clear.\"}",

This is a minor inaccuracy in the analogy's details.\"}",
    "a679c09faeec5997": "{\"accuracy\": 5, \"fluency\": 5, \"explanation\": \"This is a perfect translation. It accurately conveys the meaning of sorrow and torment for the evil-doer, both in this life and the next, with excellent fluency.\"}",
    "32b968e50e2fe8a8": "{\"accuracy\": 5, \"fluency\": 5, \"explanation\": \"This is a perfect translation. It accurately conveys the meaning of joy and delight for the good-doer, both in this life and the next, with excellent fluency.\"}",
    "fe84a04260b96ca1": "{\"accuracy\": 5, \"fluency\": 5, \"explanation\": \"This is a perfect translation. It accurately conveys the meaning of repentance and suffering for the evil-doer, especially when falling into lower realms, with excellent fluency.\"}",
    "b649f5e078f861b5": "{\"accuracy\": 5, \"fluency\": 5, \"explanation\": \"This is a perfect translation. It accurately conveys the meaning of joy and delight for the good-doer, especially when ascending to higher realms, with excellent fluency.\"}",
    "941887d917ce542e": "{\"accuracy\": 1, \"fluency\": 3, \"explanation\": \"There are multiple major errors. 'Sahita\\u1e43' is misinterpreted as 's\\u1ef1 k\\u1ebft h\\u1ee3p' instead of sacred texts/Dhamma. 'Na takkaro hoti naro pamatto' is loosely and inaccurately translated as 'ng\\u01b0\\u1eddi \\u0111\\u00e0n \\u00f4ng l\\u01b0\\u1eddi bi\\u1ebfng v\\u00e0 thi\\u1ebfu tr\\u00ed tu\\u1ec7 kh\\u00f4ng ph\\u1ea3i l\\u00e0 ng\\u01b0\\u1eddi kh\\u00f4n ngoan', missing the core meaning of 'not acting accordingly' and 'negligent'. Most critically, 's\\u0101ma\\u00f1\\u00f1assa' (the state/benefits of monkhood/asceticism) is completely misinterpreted as 's\\u1ef1 b\\u00ecnh \\u0111\\u1eb3ng'. The fluency is okay, but the meaning is severely distorted.\"}",
    "572fb171a7a9d126": "{\"accuracy\": 2, \"fluency\": 3, \"explanation\": \"Similar to Item 19, 'sahita\\u1e43' is misinterpreted as 's\\u1ef1 k\\u1ebft h\\u1ee3p'. The most significant error is the misinterpretation of 's\\u0101ma\\u00f1\\u00f1assa' (the state/benefits of monkhood/asceticism) as 's\\u1ef1 b\\u00ecnh \\u0111\\u1eb3ng th\\u1ef1c s\\u1ef1'. While other parts are accurate, this major error significantly impacts the overall meaning. The fluency is good for the parts that are correctly translated, but the misinterpretation makes the overall message less coherent.\"}"
