    "ef50a707c18d9241": "{\"accuracy\": 5, \"fluency\": 5, \"explanation\": \"Accurate and natural translation. Correctly identifies 'cakka\\u1e43va vahato pada\\u1e43' as the wheel following the hoof.\"}",
    "490bc112dd18c094": "{\"accuracy\": 5, \"fluency\": 5, \"explanation\": \"Accurate and fluent. Correctly translates 'ch\\u0101y\\u0101va anap\\u0101yin\\u012b' as the shadow not leaving the body.\"}",
    "7d09829ee1953ee5": "{\"accuracy\": 2, \"fluency\": 3, \"explanation\": \"Incorrectly translates the first line as a command ('\\u0110\\u1eebng...') instead of a description of past grievances ('He abused me...').\"}",
    "d208c9aa43952de3": "{\"accuracy\": 2, \"fluency\": 3, \"explanation\": \"Same error as Item 3; misinterprets the past tense verbs as imperatives.\"}",
    "bb2d7f47e5f8b5c6": "{\"accuracy\": 5, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"Accurate meaning, though the phrasing 'kh\\u00f4ng th\\u00f9 h\\u1eadn' is slightly less poetic than 't\\u1eeb bi' or 'kh\\u00f4ng h\\u1eadn'.\"}",
    "bcfe8e1a002daf89": "{\"accuracy\": 3, \"fluency\": 3, \"explanation\": \"Misses the specific nuance of 'yam\\u0101mase' (we are perishing/dying here) and repeats 'y\\u00ean \\u1ed5n' redundantly.\"}",
    "9d316d6545aafd2e": "{\"accuracy\": 4, \"fluency\": 3, \"explanation\": \"Translates 'subh\\u0101nupassi\\u1e43' as 't\\u00e1n t\\u1ec9nh' (flirting/courting), which is a bit odd in a Buddhist context; 'qu\\u00e1n t\\u1ecbnh' is better.\"}",
    "76f8b388eae925fc": "{\"accuracy\": 4, \"fluency\": 3, \"explanation\": \"Similar to Item 7, 't\\u00e1n t\\u1ec9nh' is an unusual choice for 'asubh\\u0101nupassi\\u1e43' (contemplating the foul).\"}",
    "c1a64c46f6f1dea0": "{\"accuracy\": 4, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"Accurate, though 'ch\\u1ec9 che gi\\u1ea5u b\\u1eb1ng \\u00e1o c\\u00e0 sa' is an interpretive addition not explicitly in the Pali.\"}",
    "77defc349489f02f": "{\"accuracy\": 5, \"fluency\": 5, \"explanation\": \"Accurate and clear translation of the qualities of one worthy of the robe.\"}",
    "f6001c8110412c5e": "{\"accuracy\": 2, \"fluency\": 3, \"explanation\": \"Misinterprets 's\\u0101ra' (essence/truth) as 'gi\\u00e1 tr\\u1ecb' (value/worth of people), changing the meaning from discerning truth to social status.\"}",
    "cc882b3a5341218c": "{\"accuracy\": 2, \"fluency\": 3, \"explanation\": \"Same error as Item 11; treats 's\\u0101ra' as a quality of people rather than the essence of reality/truth.\"}",
    "cd20c1be939b9258": "{\"accuracy\": 3, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"Translates 'vu\\u1e6d\\u1e6dh\\u012b' (rain) as 'gi\\u00f3' (wind). While the metaphor holds, it is technically inaccurate.\"}",
    "9510fef41af72996": "{\"accuracy\": 3, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"Again, translates 'vu\\u1e6d\\u1e6dh\\u012b' (rain) as 'gi\\u00f3' (wind).\"}",
    "9de1cab0136d70cc": "{\"accuracy\": 5, \"fluency\": 5, \"explanation\": \"Accurate and captures the repetitive structure of the Pali verse well.\"}",
    "105e75390170e64f": "{\"accuracy\": 4, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"Accurate, though it contains a Chinese character '\\u5584' instead of the Vietnamese word 'thi\\u1ec7n'.\"}",
    "7a68e3069dd1af9e": "{\"accuracy\": 5, \"fluency\": 5, \"explanation\": \"Accurate translation of 'tappati' as 'h\\u1ed1i h\\u1eadn' (remorse/suffering).\"}",

    "6e0b3292667d4397": "{\"accuracy\": 2, \"fluency\": 3, \"explanation\": \"Major errors: 'sahita\\u1e43' refers to scriptures/texts, not 'cooperation'. 'S\\u0101ma\\u00f1\\u00f1assa' refers to the ascetic life, not 'equality'.\"}",
    "6594356f3404cf76": "{\"accuracy\": 2, \"fluency\": 3, \"explanation\": \"Same errors as Item 19: misinterprets 'sahita\\u1e43' and 's\\u0101ma\\u00f1\\u00f1assa'.\"}",
    "d10b487cc97fffb1": "{\"accuracy\": 4, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"Accurate meaning, but 't\\u00e2m nhanh nh\\u01b0 \\u00fd' is a slight misinterpretation of 'manojav\\u0101\\u1e25' (mind-impelled/swift as mind) and 'b\\u00e1nh xe theo ch\\u00e2n ng\\u1ef1a' adds 'horse' which isn't in the text (vahata\\u1e25 refers to the ox/beast of burden).\"}",
    "37b38f7d928bf825": "{\"accuracy\": 5, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"Accurate translation of the positive counterpart to Item 1. Fluency is good, though slightly prose-heavy compared to the verse structure.\"}",
    "da342105b52051a3": "{\"accuracy\": 3, \"fluency\": 3, \"explanation\": \"The candidate misses the specific nuances of 'ayojan' (bound/oppressed) and 'aj\\u0101payet' (conquered/robbed), generalizing them as 'ghen gh\\u00e9t' (envy/jealousy).\"}",
    "36cc4e1e4c8c9124": "{\"accuracy\": 3, \"fluency\": 3, \"explanation\": \"Similar to Item 3, it misses the specific verbs of the first half, though the second half correctly identifies the cessation of hatred.\"}",
    "fffb931dd3da9854": "{\"accuracy\": 4, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"Accurate, but translating 'dharma' as 'ph\\u00e1p lu\\u1eadt' (secular law) is slightly less appropriate than '\\u0111\\u1ecbnh lu\\u1eadt' or 'ph\\u00e1p' in a Buddhist context.\"}",
    "3e2a93822be65a39": "{\"accuracy\": 3, \"fluency\": 3, \"explanation\": \"The translation of 'yam\\u0101mahe' as 't\\u1ef1 ki\\u1ec1m ch\\u1ebf' is one interpretation, but the candidate misses the nuance of 'medhak\\u0101\\u1e25' (quarrels/strife) at the end, translating it vaguely as 'an y\\u00ean'.\"}",
    "02247372ece8825b": "{\"accuracy\": 4, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"Good accuracy. 'G\\u1ea7n g\\u0169i v\\u1edbi \\u0111i\\u1ec1u t\\u1ed1t \\u0111\\u1eb9p' for '\\u015aubh\\u0101nupa\\u015by\\u012b' (contemplating the pleasant) is slightly off; it usually refers to focusing on attractive aspects that trigger lust.\"}",
    "e11a0f99bc9d0642": "{\"accuracy\": 3, \"fluency\": 2, \"explanation\": \"Contains a Chinese character error ('\\u4e0d\\u597d') in the Vietnamese text. 'A\\u015bubh\\u0101nupa\\u015by\\u012b' means contemplating the unattractive/impurity, not just 'bad things'.\"}",
    "986cfbfcec326a7d": "{\"accuracy\": 3, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"Translates 'ani\\u1e63ka\\u1e63\\u0101ya\\u1e25' (not free from impurities) as 'kh\\u00f4ng c\\u00f3 l\\u00f2ng t\\u1eeb bi' (no compassion), which is a thematic leap rather than a literal translation.\"}",
    "623283534a86c707": "{\"accuracy\": 3, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"Similar to Item 9, it replaces 'purity from stains' and 'self-restraint' with 'compassion' and 'humility', which are not the direct meanings of the Sanskrit terms.\"}",
    "36962b8ef19e11f9": "{\"accuracy\": 5, \"fluency\": 5, \"explanation\": \"Excellent translation. Captures the essence of 's\\u0101ra' (essence/value) and 'as\\u0101ra' (non-essence) very clearly in natural Vietnamese.\"}",
    "868f6ac88dd2a4b5": "{\"accuracy\": 5, \"fluency\": 5, \"explanation\": \"Consistent with Item 11, providing a clear and accurate contrast between essence and non-essence.\"}",
    "47abf0be759ce953": "{\"accuracy\": 4, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"Accurate. 'Kh\\u00f4ng c\\u00f3 m\\u00e1i che' is slightly different from 'duchanna\\u1e43' (badly thatched), but the metaphor remains intact.\"}",
    "fb8db820be4880b3": "{\"accuracy\": 4, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"Accurate and clear. Good parallel to Item 13.\"}",
    "95a5960d2da279ee": "{\"accuracy\": 5, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"Accurate translation of the Sanskrit '\\u015bocati' (grieves/sorrows) and the realization of one's own defiled actions.\"}",

    "dec603198926554f": "{\"accuracy\": 4, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"Good translation of the 'cowherd' metaphor. 'Sahita\\u1e43' usually refers to scriptures/texts, which 'n\\u00f3i nhi\\u1ec1u' captures generally.\"}",
