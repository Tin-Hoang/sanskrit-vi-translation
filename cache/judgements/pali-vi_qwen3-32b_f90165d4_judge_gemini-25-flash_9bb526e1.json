'ajini ma\\u1e43' is again mistranslated, 'ah\\u0101si me' is omitted. 'n\\u016bpanayhanti' (do not bear a grudge) is not captured, and 'vera\\u1e43 tes\\u016bpasammati' (their hatred ceases) is mistranslated as 'l\\u00f2ng gh\\u00e9t b\\u1ecf c\\u1ee7a h\\u1ecd s\\u1ebd \\u0111\\u01b0\\u1ee3c ch\\u1ea5p nh\\u1eadn' (their hatred will be accepted).\"}",
    "1bb706188316c22f": "{\"accuracy\": 5, \"fluency\": 5, \"explanation\": \"The translation is perfectly accurate, capturing the essence of the Pali verse. The Vietnamese is natural, concise, and impactful.\"}",
    "63fcab6e195f358c": "{\"accuracy\": 1, \"fluency\": 2, \"explanation\": \"This translation has major accuracy issues. 'mayamettha yam\\u0101mase' (we here shall perish) is completely misinterpreted as 'ta kh\\u00f4ng mong h\\u1ecd hi\\u1ec3u' (I don't expect them to understand). 'medhag\\u0101' (quarrels/disputes) is mistranslated as 'tr\\u00ed tu\\u1ec7' (wisdom), fundamentally altering the message about the cessation of disputes.\"}",
    "5f81185cccedb1f6": "{\"accuracy\": 2, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"There's a major error in the first phrase: 'Subh\\u0101nupassi\\u1e43 viharanta\\u1e43' (dwelling contemplating the beautiful/pleasant) is incorrectly translated as 'kh\\u00f4ng qu\\u00e1n t\\u01b0\\u1edfng s\\u1ef1 x\\u1ea5u' (not contemplating the ugly), which inverts the meaning.

    "3a9b242e766d02b5": "{\"accuracy\": 3, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"The translation misses a key concept: 'dama' (self-restraint) is omitted from 'damasaccena'. 'Anikkas\\u0101vo' (without stain/impurity) is translated as 'kh\\u00f4ng c\\u00f3 gi\\u1edbi lu\\u1eadt' (without precepts), which is related but less precise than 't\\u00e2m ch\\u01b0a r\\u1eddi u\\u1ebf tr\\u01b0\\u1ee3c' (mind not free from defilements).\"}",
    "d4f62190b2c12219": "{\"accuracy\": 2, \"fluency\": 4, \"explanation\": \"This translation has significant errors. 'vantakas\\u0101vassa' (one who has spit out defilements) is loosely translated as 's\\u1ed1ng ph\\u1ea1m h\\u1ea1nh' (lives a holy life). More critically, 'dama' (self-restraint) from 'damasaccena' is mistranslated as 't\\u1ef1 tinh t\\u1ea5n' (self-diligence), and 'sacca' (truth) is omitted entirely.\"}",
    "72c017f84554dc33": "{\"accuracy\": 1, \"fluency\": 1, \"explanation\": \"This translation is fundamentally flawed. The first two phrases 'As\\u0101re s\\u0101ramatino, s\\u0101re c\\u0101s\\u0101radassino' (perceiving essence in the non-essential, and non-essence in the essential) are completely misinterpreted and inverted, leading to contradictory and nonsensical phrasing like 'Nh\\u1eefng ng\\u01b0\\u1eddi kh\\u00f4ng hi\\u1ec3u r\\u00f5 s\\u1ef1 th\\u1eadt, nh\\u1eefng ng\\u01b0\\u1eddi hi\\u1ec3u r\\u00f5 s\\u1ef1 th\\u1eadt'.\"}",

    "bf73d97728e1fbb5": "{\"accuracy\": 4, \"fluency\": 5, \"explanation\": \"The translation is largely accurate. 'socati' (grieves/sorrows) is translated as '\\u0111au kh\\u1ed5' (suffers), which is a good equivalent. 'viha\\u00f1\\u00f1ati' (tormented) as 'tuy\\u1ec7t v\\u1ecdng' (desperate) is a strong interpretation but acceptable. 'kammakili\\u1e6d\\u1e6dhamattano' (his own defiled action) as 'qu\\u1ea3 b\\u00e1o c\\u1ee7a ch\\u00ednh m\\u00ecnh' (his own retribution) is a reasonable inference.\"}",
    "b942857f5b998959": "{\"accuracy\": 4, \"fluency\": 5, \"explanation\": \"The translation is mostly accurate. 'modati' (rejoices) as 'vui'/'vui s\\u01b0\\u1edbng' (happy/joyful) is good.

    "4345e01d4cde5af7": "{\"accuracy\": 4, \"fluency\": 5, \"explanation\": \"The translation is generally accurate. 'tappati' (suffers/is tormented) is translated as 'run r\\u1ea9y' (trembles/shivers), which is a consequence of suffering rather than suffering itself, a slight shift in nuance. The rest is well translated.\"}",
    "7e717f3108c03b8a": "{\"accuracy\": 5, \"fluency\": 5, \"explanation\": \"This translation is perfectly accurate, conveying the meaning of delight and the positive outcome of good deeds with excellent fluency.\"}",
    "eea406dfd03792a4": "{\"accuracy\": 1, \"fluency\": 3, \"explanation\": \"This translation contains multiple major errors. 'sahita\\u1e43 bh\\u0101sam\\u0101no' (reciting much scripture) is mistranslated as 'n\\u00f3i chuy\\u1ec7n v\\u1edbi nhi\\u1ec1u ng\\u01b0\\u1eddi' (talking with many people). 'na takkaro hoti' (is not a doer of it) is omitted. The simile 'Gopova g\\u0101vo ga\\u1e47aya\\u1e43 paresa\\u1e43' (like a cowherd counting others' cows) is completely misinterpreted as 'Gi\\u1ed1ng nh\\u01b0 con b\\u00f2 kh\\u00f4ng thu\\u1ed9c \\u0111\\u00e0n' (like a cow not belonging to the herd).\"}",

This misinterpretation makes the opening clause somewhat awkward in context. The rest of the translation is accurate.\"}"
